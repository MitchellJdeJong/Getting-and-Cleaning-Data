#####Summary
This project uses the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" (Anguita, 2012) and creates a summarizing dataset in narrow-form from the original data. The summary meets the following criteria for tidy data (Wickham, 2014):
* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each type of observation unit forms a table.


#####This repository includes:
* 'README.md'
